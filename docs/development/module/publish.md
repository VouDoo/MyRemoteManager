# Module - Publish

## Publish to PowerShell repository

First of all, you need to get an API key to push the module to the repository.

Create an environment variable on your system as `MyRemoteManager_API_KEY` and set its value with the key.

Run the `Publish` psake task to automatically publish the module.
